## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Nodes not saving?
- Check your internet connection
- Ensure you're logged in
- Try refreshing the page

### Can't connect nodes?
- Make sure both nodes are saved (have valid data)
- Only connect: Objective → KR or KR → Initiative
- Can't connect same type (e.g., Objective → Objective)

### Layout not persisting?
- Click "Save Layout" button explicitly
- Positions save per-OKR, not canvas-wide
