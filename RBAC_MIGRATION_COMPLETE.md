# RBAC Migration Complete ✅

## Overview

The RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) system has been successfully integrated into the OKR Framework. All OKR-related controllers have been migrated from the old `PermissionGuard` system to the new `RBACGuard` with `@RequireAction()` decorators.

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 1. Database Migration
- ✅ Migration exists: `20251030162756_add_rbac_system_with_whitelist`
- ✅ Database schema is up to date with RoleAssignment table
- ✅ Verified migrations: `npx prisma migrate status` confirms all migrations applied

### 2. Module Integration
- ✅ `RBACModule` imported in `app.module.ts`
- ✅ `PermissionModule` kept for backward compatibility during transition
- ✅ RBAC guards and services available throughout the application

### 3. Controller Migration

#### OKR Module (100% Complete)
- ✅ **ObjectiveController** - Migrated to RBAC
  - `@RequireAction('view_okr')` for GET routes
  - `@RequireAction('create_okr')` for POST
  - `@RequireAction('edit_okr')` for PATCH
  - `@RequireAction('delete_okr')` for DELETE

- ✅ **KeyResultController** - Migrated to RBAC
  - `@RequireAction('view_okr')` for GET routes
  - `@RequireAction('create_okr')` for POST
  - `@RequireAction('edit_okr')` for PATCH and check-in
  - `@RequireAction('delete_okr')` for DELETE

- ✅ **InitiativeController** - Migrated to RBAC
  - `@RequireAction('view_okr')` for GET routes
  - `@RequireAction('create_okr')` for POST
  - `@RequireAction('edit_okr')` for PATCH
  - `@RequireAction('delete_okr')` for DELETE

### 4. Migration Tools
- ✅ Migration script created: `scripts/migrate-rbac.ts`
- ✅ Migration endpoint available: `POST /rbac/migration/all`
- ✅ Verification endpoint: `GET /rbac/migration/verify`

## 📋 Next Steps (Optional)

### 1. Run Data Migration

Migrate existing OrganizationMember, WorkspaceMember, and TeamMember records to RoleAssignment:

**Option A: Via REST API**
```bash
# After starting the API server
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/rbac/migration/all \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"migratedBy": "your-user-id"}'
```

**Option B: Via Script**
```bash
cd services/core-api
npx ts-node scripts/migrate-rbac.ts
```

**Verify Migration**
```bash
curl http://localhost:3001/rbac/migration/verify \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
```

### 2. Migrate Additional Controllers (Optional)

Other controllers that could be migrated:
- `UserController` - Currently uses `TenantIsolationGuard`
- `OrganizationController` - Currently uses `TenantIsolationGuard`
- `WorkspaceController` - Currently uses `TenantIsolationGuard`
- `TeamController` - Currently uses guards

These can be migrated gradually as needed.

### 3. Remove PermissionModule (Future)

Once all controllers are migrated and you've verified everything works:
1. Remove `PermissionModule` from `app.module.ts`
2. Clean up unused `PermissionGuard` imports
3. Update any remaining services using `PermissionService`

## 🎯 What Changed

### Before (Old System)
```typescript
@UseGuards(JwtAuthGuard, PermissionGuard)
export class ObjectiveController {
  @RequirePermission(Permission.OKR_VIEW)
  async getAll() { ... }
}
```

### After (New RBAC System)
```typescript
@UseGuards(JwtAuthGuard, RBACGuard)
export class ObjectiveController {
  @RequireAction('view_okr')
  async getAll() { ... }
}
```

## 🔍 Benefits of RBAC System

1. **More Granular Roles**: 10 roles vs 6 in old system
2. **Visibility-Based Access**: OKRs can have visibility levels (PUBLIC_TENANT, WORKSPACE_ONLY, TEAM_ONLY, etc.)
3. **Better Performance**: 5-minute caching with automatic invalidation
4. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support for roles and actions
5. **Audit Logging**: Built-in audit trail for all permission changes
6. **Scalability**: Supports complex multi-tenant scenarios

## 📚 Documentation

- **RBAC README**: `services/core-api/src/modules/rbac/README.md`
- **Migration Guide**: `services/core-api/src/modules/rbac/MIGRATION_GUIDE.md`
- **Usage Examples**: `services/core-api/src/modules/rbac/USAGE_EXAMPLES.md`
- **Implementation Summary**: `services/core-api/src/modules/rbac/IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`

## ✨ Summary

The RBAC system is **fully integrated and ready to use**. All OKR controllers are protected with the new system. The old permission system remains for backward compatibility, but you can start using RBAC immediately.

**Status**: ✅ Migration Complete - OKR Module Fully Migrated
