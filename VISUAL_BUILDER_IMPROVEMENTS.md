**Date**: December 2024  
**Status**: ✅ Phase 1 Complete

---

## 🎉 What Was Implemented

### ✅ **1. Slide-Out Edit Panel** (Critical Fix)
**Before**: Full-screen modal blocking entire canvas  
**After**: Right-side slide-out panel (450px wide) maintaining visual context

**Benefits**:
- Users can see canvas and relationships while editing
- More modern, integrated feel
- Faster workflow - can reference other nodes

**Files Created**:
- `apps/web/src/app/dashboard/builder/components/EditPanel.tsx`

---

### ✅ **2. Inline Title Editing** (Quick Wins)
**Before**: Must open modal for any edit  
**After**: Double-click title to edit inline directly on node

**Features**:
- Double-click node title → Inline input appears
- Enter to save, Escape to cancel
- Auto-saves to backend
- Works for all node types (Objective, Key Result, Initiative)

**Benefits**:
- Common edits (title changes) take < 5 seconds
- No modal interruption for simple changes
- More natural interaction

**Files Created**:
- `apps/web/src/app/dashboard/builder/components/EnhancedNodes.tsx`

---

### ✅ **3. Auto-Save Node Positions** (UX Improvement)
**Before**: Manual "Save Layout" button required  
**After**: Auto-saves positions when dragging stops (500ms debounce)

**Features**:
- Automatic position persistence
- Visual indicators: "Saving..." → "Saved ✓"
- Debounced to avoid excessive API calls
- Removed manual save button (replaced with status indicator)

**Benefits**:
- Users don't lose work
- One less thing to remember
- Seamless experience

**Files Created**:
- `apps/web/src/app/dashboard/builder/hooks/useAutoSave.ts`

---

### ✅ **4. Progressive Disclosure Edit Form** (Reduced Overwhelm)
**Before**: Single massive form with all fields visible  
**After**: Tabbed interface with "Basic", "Details", "Advanced" tabs

**Tab Structure**:
- **Basic Tab**: Title, Description, Progress, Key Values (most common fields)
- **Details Tab**: Time Frame, Period, Dates
- **Advanced Tab**: Owner, Context Assignment, Parent Objective, Metadata

**Benefits**:
- Reduces form overwhelm
- Users see only what they need
- Common edits are faster (just Basic tab)
- Advanced options still accessible but not distracting

**Files Created**:
- `apps/web/src/app/dashboard/builder/components/EditFormTabs.tsx`
- `apps/web/src/components/ui/tabs.tsx` (Radix UI wrapper)

---

### ✅ **5. Enhanced Node Visual Design**
**Improvements**:
- Larger nodes (260px × 120px vs 240px × 110px)
- Always-visible connection handles (4px circles vs 3px, with white border)
- Better hover states (scale 1.02, shadow increase)
- Improved typography and spacing
- Visual feedback on interactions

**Benefits**:
- Easier to see and interact with
